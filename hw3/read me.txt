1.ANN_alg.java is for experiments (i) (ii) and (iii). And testIrisNoisy.java is for experiment (iv).

2.Input the absolute path for each file,follow the indicate in the program.For Identity experiment (i),it will print the hidden units values.

3.For example about the file path in eclipse: E:/Machine Learning/hw3/iris-attr.txt

4.In the experiment (iv), for the testIrisNoisy.java, if the " number of iterations " too high,it will cost a lot time consume. So I suggest input less than 700.
