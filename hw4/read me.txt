1.Genetic_Algorithm.java is for experiments (i) and (ii).
  testIrisSelection.java is for experiment (iii).
  testIrisReplacement.java is for experiment (iv).

2.Input the absolute path for each file,follow the indicate in the program.

3.For example about the file path in eclipse: E:/Machine Learning/hw4/iris-attr.txt

4.In all experiments, in my experience, a probable size for population is around 50 to 80. And a probable max generation size is around 500.And the fitness threshold can be 0.96.

5.In my experience,"fitness-proportional" and "tournament" have the similar performance in term of the fitness and accuracy.
As to "rank", the fitness sometimes changes a lot. Which means sometimes it can get a final high accuracy and fitness,but sometimes not.
And moreover, for "rank" durning one running time, its fitness is not as stable as other two strategies.
